     * passed to mpi immediately to get rid at least of algorithmic latency.
     *
     * While the arguing above in principle is correct, it lacks one imporant
     * fact: The heap uses three different buffers (fork/join, boundary,
     * master/worker). And the choice of the predefined heap just is a choice
     * of different boundary buffers. Those however are not used to transport
     * particles at all in pit.

/**
 * PiT Cell
 * 
 * A cell in the PiT code is pretty simple: It basically only holds an index
 * for the heap. This index tells the heap which particles are assigned to the
 * cell.
 *
 * Besides that simple attribute, there is also a counter of particles. For
 * the leaves, this counter (set by the lift mechanism) equals the number of
 * particles assigned to the cell. For refined cells, the counter holds the
 * reduced values of all the children.
